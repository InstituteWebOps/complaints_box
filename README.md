# Hostel complaints
Hostel complaints will feature an interactive but controlled portal where students can view all the
complaints against their hostel along with registering new complaints. Each student will have
access only to his hostel's portal. There will be three main pages- for registering a complaint, for
viewing all complaints and the third to view all complaints registered by him/her.
There are two types of complaints, template complaints and general complaints. Template
complaints are the standard issues which students might face while staying in the hostel like
malfunctioning washing machine. I have collected such templated from the Narmada complaints
google form. Students can only upvote such complaints. The second general complaints is a full
featured complaint where students can comment on, upvote or even downvote.You can even
tag secretaries you wish to address in such type of complaints. There will be a search bar where
secretaries can search complaints addressed to them by entering the tag. Tags can be anything
from a secretary to an issue which is prevalent in the hostel.
The major advantage of this portal over conventional google forms used by most hostels is
accessibility, transparency and tracking of complaints. Each complaint will be marked as either
resolved or unresolved. Only the complainer can resolve his complaint in the ‘My complaints’
section. The user will be notified to mark his/her complaint as resolved once the issue is settled.
Secretaries can search #washingmachine and know how many of them have malfunctioned,
thus addressing all of them in a single visit of the repair agent. Spam controls will be set in place
ensuring smooth working of the portal.
